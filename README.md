# Sparta-Project-2 / SQL-Automation-Checker-App

### Description
For this project, we have created an automated SQL checker application which automatically compares the answers written by trainees during their SQL assessment against the expected answers stored in a created database. Once trainees have completed their assessments, test results are produced for the trainers in Sparta Global which avoids the chance of human error or ambiguities when marking the assessments manually. The automated application provides an efficient way for trainers to evaluate their streams as a collective as well as individual trainee performance.
